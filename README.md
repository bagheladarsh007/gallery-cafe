Welcome to the repository for The Gallery Cafe's website task. This project is designed to practice various HTML tags and elements. Let's break down the different sections of the webpage and see which HTML tags were used.
## Screenshots and Explanation
### About us Section 
 In this section, we have used heading tags `<h2>` for "About us" and `<p>` tag for the Lorem ipsum text. Here's how it looks:

## Learning

Through this task, I've gained practical experience with opening and closing tags, nesting elements, using basic tags like `<h2>`, `<p>`, `<a>`, `<ol>`, and `<li>`, and created different sections of a webpage.
